## About GPT-3 Sentiment

This is a very basic and simple app that allows you to insert a string into a textfield and then get the
general sentiment of that string based on `GPT-3 text-davinci-003` processing.

It's built in Laravel currently, as the idea for this began as something akin to suite of tools and ways to
utilize AI within an organization.

The GPT-3 Sentiment Checker is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


## Roadmap & Future Plans

I'll update this section soon. Ultimately, this will be a stand-alone tool to check sentiment of text. It'll likely remain built
with Laravel as I intend to expand on the core features over time.
